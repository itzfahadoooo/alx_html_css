# CSS Advanced Project - SmileSchool

This project is part of the ALX Frontend curriculum focused on mastering HTML & CSS without external libraries. It recreates a SmileSchool landing page from a Figma design using only vanilla HTML and CSS.

- How CSS specificity works and how to calculate it
- Box model properties: margin, border, padding, and content
- How browsers parse HTML and apply CSS
- How to link external stylesheets using `<link>`

## 🚀 Features Implemented

- Fully structured HTML5 page with semantic elements
- External stylesheet (`styles.css`) imported
- Layout and design inspired directly from Figma
- Responsive header, banner, quotes, video cards, membership, FAQ, and footer sections
- Fully W3C-compliant and accessible

## 🚫 Restrictions
